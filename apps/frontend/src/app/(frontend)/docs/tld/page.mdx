title: TLD's for cold email campaigns
description: Decide which TLD to use for cold email

.dev domains are risky as hell for cold outreach. Working at an agency that handles campaigns for clients, we've tested this extensively and deliverability sucks.

Most spam filters flag non-.com domains automatically, especially newer TLDs like .dev. Your emails will hit spam folders before anyone even sees them.

Also, .dev domains require HTTPS which can complicate email authentication setup if you don't know what you're doing. Most people fuck up the DNS records and tank their sender reputation.

Stick with .com domains for cold email. Yeah they're more expensive but your delivery rates will be way better. We've seen 40-50% better inbox placement with .com vs newer TLDs.
